\section{Sorting Functions}
\label{sec:application}
\label{sec:sorting}

We will now put to work the universal properties of our types of (ordered) lists and unordered lists,
to define operations on them systematically, which are mathematically sound, and reason about them.
%
First, we explore definitions of various operations on both free monoids and free commutative monoids.
%
By univalence (and the structure identity principle), everything henceforth holds for any presentation of free monoids
and free commutative monoids.
%
We use $\FF(A)$ to denote the free monoid or free commutative monoid on $A$,
$\LL(A)$ to exclusively denote the free monoid construction,
and $\MM(A)$ to exclusively denote the free commutative monoid construction.

%
For example $\term{length}$ is a common operation defined inductively for $\List$,
but usually, properties about $\term{length}$, such as,
$\term{length}(\xs \doubleplus \ys) = \term{length}(\xs) + \term{length}(\ys)$,
are proven separately after defining it.
%
In our framework of free algebras, where the $\ext{(\blank)}$ operation is a correct-by-construction homomorphism,
we can define operations like $\term{length}$ directly by universal extension,
which also gives us a proof that they are homomorphisms for free.
%
A further application of the universal property is to prove that two different types are equal,
by showing they both satisfy the same universal property as in~\cref{lem:free-algebras-unique},
which is desirable especially when proving a direct equivalence between the two types turns out
to be a difficult exercise in combinatorics.
